# 100 PushUps a Day for Cancer Research UK

I am doing 100 push ups a day over April to raise funds Cancer Research UK. [Sponsorship appreciated](https://fundraise.cancerresearchuk.org/page/fintans-giving-page-6). I be keeping a log here and posting a bit about on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fintanr).

100 push ups on their own is a bit tiresome and boring, so I break them up into a pyramid of sorts, and do some other exercises in between. 
So the routine is 3 pyramids, 10 - 8 - 6 - 6 with 5 reps of something else between each phase, with 45 seconds rest between each pyramid and then a final 10 push ups. 

| Day | PushUps| Pyramid 1 | Pyramid 2 | Pyramid 3 | Final | Time |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|April 1|100| 30 PU + 10S, 10BWS| 30 PU +10S, 10IR | 30 PU + 10S, 10BW| 10 PU | 8:31 |


Key: PU - Push Ups. S - Situps. BWs - Body Weight Squarts. IR - Inverted Row
